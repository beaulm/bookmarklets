# Bookmarklets
Handy bookmarklets for working with Optimizely, Monetate and Adobe Analytics(SiteCatalyst/Omniture).

## How to use these ##

**Do this once:**
* In your browser, add a new bookmark
* Name it whatever you want (Optimizely Info) for instance
* For the page/url, paste in the code from one of the files in the `bookmarklets` folder
* Save and that's it!

**When you're on a page that you want to know about:**
* Click on your bookmarklet

Many of the bookmarklets output things into the console. To see the output:
* Open the developer tools in your browser. [Here's instructions for chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)
* Go to the console

It's really not all that hard. I've made a quick video which puts that all together: https://goo.gl/n7kQPa
